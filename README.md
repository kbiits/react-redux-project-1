# Easy Login App with React Redux

This website is built with react and redux. The main purpose of this project is to learn how to use redux as state management for react app. The website only contains 2 pages which are Login Page and Home Page.  
  
Flow of the website is when you submit the login form, the app will dispatch the Login Action and the Login Reducer will generate the new state and save it in the store. And if the logout button clicked, the app will dispatch the Logout Action and the Logout Reducer will generate the new state or more specifically the Logout Reducer just make the state which created by Login Reducer to be null
